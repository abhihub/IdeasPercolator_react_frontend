# Motivation - Learn react by building a simple way of tracking maturity of an idea (or a thesis)
Write ideas and percolate them to maturity by adding context

Created simple list management system for ideas. Underlying goal and thesis: Ideas are immature at birth. Give them more context over time by rethinking about them, sharing with other, finding sources to back up the idea and updating them with new learnings.
